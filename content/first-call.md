# First Call Script

## Opening (30 seconds)
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm calling because you recently expressed interest in learning about affordable health insurance options. Do you have 5 minutes to chat about how we might be able to save you money while getting better coverage?"

## Discovery (3-5 minutes)
- "Tell me about your current insurance situation..."
- "What's most important to you in a health plan?"
- "What challenges have you faced with insurance in the past?"
- "Who else would be covered under this plan?"
- "What's your ideal monthly budget for health insurance?"

## Presentation (5-7 minutes)
Match their needs to specific benefits:
- "Based on what you've told me about [specific need], our [plan feature] would be perfect because..."
- "You mentioned [pain point]. This plan addresses that by..."
- "For your family of [size], you'd be looking at approximately [price range]..."

## Common Objections & Responses

### "It's too expensive"
"I understand cost is important. Let me ask - what would happen if you or a family member had a medical emergency tomorrow without coverage? This plan is actually an investment in protecting your family's financial future."

### "I need to think about it"
"Of course, this is an important decision. What specific concerns do you want to think through? I'm here to answer any questions that might help you make the best decision for your family."

### "I already have coverage"
"That's great that you're already protected! Many of my clients found they were overpaying for less coverage. Would you be open to a quick comparison to see if we could save you money?"

## Close (2-3 minutes)
"Based on everything we've discussed, it sounds like the [specific plan] would be a great fit for you. I can get you enrolled right now and have your coverage start as soon as [date]. Should we move forward?"

If yes: Process enrollment
If no: "What's holding you back? Is there something specific I can clarify?"
